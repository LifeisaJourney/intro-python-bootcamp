# Data Analysis
## Objectives
- use csv library to read in data
- use Python techniques to extract insights about the data

1. Using csv library, read in data from rock.csv, which you can download here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/cbffxkqq0ujru58/rock.csv?dl=0

2. How many songs are from 1981?

3. How many songs are from before 1984

4. What is the earliest release year in the data? (HINT: You might have to account for/clean up dirty data)

5. What are the top 20 songs by play count (HINT: use builtin sorted() function, documentation here: https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting)

6. Who are the top 10 most prolific artists in the data along with the number of their songs that appear in the data?

7. How many different artists appear in the data?
